========================================================
  
This directory contains scripts to predict cytogenetic risk and abnormalities using an SVM with linear modeling and correlation-based feature selection.

Contents:
* The final Rmd script: [here](https://github.com/rdocking/stat540-group-project-aml-cnv/blob/master/code/svm_exploratory/svm_predictions_new.Rmd)
* The HTML report: [here](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/rdocking/stat540-group-project-aml-cnv/blob/master/code/svm_exploratory/svm_predictions_new.html)
* The original Rmd script: [here](https://github.com/rdocking/stat540-group-project-aml-cnv/blob/master/code/svm_exploratory/svm_predictions.Rmd)

Note: The original Rmd script contains my original work. The final Rmd script was created by taking Lauren's work with random forests and modifying to use an SVM. This was done so that Lauren and I could be sure that our predictors were exactly the same except for the type of classfier we were using.
