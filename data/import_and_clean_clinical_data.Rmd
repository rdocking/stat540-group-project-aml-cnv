Clinical Data Import and Cleaning
=================================

Read in the clinical data-sheet from the [TCGA Publication Website](https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/docs/publications/laml_2012/):

```{r}
library(RCurl)
library(knitr)
d <- getURL("https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/docs/publications/laml_2012/clinical_patient_laml.tsv")
raw_clinical_data <- read.table(text=d, header=TRUE, sep='\t')
```

This data-sheet has a lot more data than we'll actually need for this project:

```{r}
dim(raw_clinical_data)
```

Also available, as an Excel sheet, is a Supplementary table listing much of the same information, but with more annotation:

*Note that we're using the updated version as of 2013-05-13. Since the data is only available as an Excel sheet, we've done some manipulation outside of R:*

- Download the Supplementary file from [the paper website](https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/docs/publications/laml_2012/SuppTable01.update.2013.05.13.xlsx)
- Open in Excel, Save as CSV

```{r}
supp_d <- read.csv('SuppTable01.update.2013.05.13.csv')
dim(supp_d)
```

As a first pass, we'll try to clean the `cytogenetic_abnormality` column from the raw clinical data into a simpler categorical variable:

```{r}
summary(raw_clinical_data$cytogenetic_abnormality)
```

There are some immediate problems with this approach:

- 19 samples are missing data
- Several samples have many of the CNAs of interest
- The notation seems inconsistent between samples

*Note: Supplemenary Table 5 from the paper website might be an alternate approach here - this lists the inferred CNAs directly*

Alternate approaches possible:

1. Limit the analysis to things with a single, distinct karyotypic event (will lose lots of samples)
2. Make a 'best guess' at the most relevant alteration for each sample (messy)
3. Make several different binary variables for each of the main CNAs, e.g.:

| Patient | del(5q) | del(7q) | Trisomy 8 | t(15:17) | inv(16) | 
| ------- | ------- | ------- | --------- | -------- | ------- |
| 1 | T | F | F | F |T |
| 2 | F | F | F |T | F |

Thoughts? This would make the annotation simpler, but might complicate the analysis a bit.

### Followup to that question: 

#### Summarize Columns in Raw Clinical Data and Supplementary Table 1

To address the comments at [issue #3](https://github.com/rdocking/stat540-group-project-aml-cnv/issues/3), I'm going to try a few approaches to stratifying the data-set.

First, I'll work on trying to get a workable stratification out of the `raw_clinical_data` imported above. The main issues I've been having so far:

- In the `cytogenetic_abnormality` column, the entries are sometimes split by pipes, e.g. 'Normal|del (7q) / 7q-' vs. 'del (7q) / 7q-' - it's not clear that these should be treated equivalently.
- There is a second column, `cytogenetic_abnormality_other` that is even more inconsistently filled in (i.e. no data for 172 samples, uses 'no', 'No', and 'NO' for others)

This is looking a bit like a rabbit-hole. I'm going to try another tack and see if I can regenerate the sample counts from Table 1 in the main text of the paper:

![Table 1 Snippet](table_1_snippet.png)

From Supplementary Table 1, (loaded above as `supp_d`), the cytogenetic data is available in the following columns:

- `Cytogenetics` - karyotype using [cytogenetic nomenclature](http://www.radford.edu/~rsheehy/cytogenetics/Cytogenetic_Nomeclature.html). These seem consistently filled in (yay!), but are tricky to parse (boo!)
- `Gene Fusions by RNA-Seq` - predicted gene fusions from the RNA-Seq data. This has entries like 'PML(+)RARA(+) (In frame)', which corresponds to 't(15;17)' from the `Cytogenetics` column. This _should_ be pretty accurate for fusions, but not for CNAs
- `Inferred genomic rearrangement (from RNA-Seq fusion)` - translation of `Gene Fusions by RNA-Seq` into `Cytogenetics` nomenclature
- `Cytogenetic Classification` - A categorical variable summarizing the previous columns:

```{r}
summary(supp_d$Cytogenetic.Classification)
```

  this is _not quite_ what we're after - we'd like to call individual karyotype-level events.
- `RISK (Cyto)` - another categorical classification of the samples by risk type:

```{r}
summary(supp_d$RISK..Cyto.)
```

- Then two more classifications, `Molecular Classification` and `RISK (Molecular)`
  
#### Annotate Samples with Karyotypic events of interest  

Per conversation with group members and Shaun, I'll clean the supplemental data in `SuppTable01.update.2013.05.13.csv`. Note that I'm doing this in Python (with ` parse_supplementary_table.py`) for expediency.

Manipulations are as follows:

- Select a relevant subset of variables
- For variables that can be converted to boolean types, do so
- Convert column names to be more R-friendly (e.g., `'Expired?  4.30.13'` became `Expired` and `'%BM Blast'` became `BM_blast_pct`)

The script should be run like so:

```
python parse_supplementary_table.py > experimental_design.csv
```


Now I can read in the modified CSV file to get a cleaner data frame:

```{r}
cleaned <- read.csv('experimental_design.csv')
```
