=============================

Group project for STAT540, 2014 Edition. Detection of CNV events in Acute Myeloid Leukemia using RNA-Seq data

Project Description
-------------------

Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) is characterized by recurrent, large-scale chromosomal abnormalities.
Detection of these abnormalities is typically done through karyoptying, or through dedicated approaches like array-CGH.
This project will attempt to infer these events using RNA-Seq data. Since changes in gene expression linked to these large-scale chromosomal abnormalities are not expected to be simple, we will employ a range of approaches (TBD, but most likely including some sort of machine learning or clustering approaches) to predict these events. 

Data Sets
---------

The main data sets are:

- RNA-Seq data from patients with AML
- Karyotype information detailing large-scale chromosomal abnormalities
- arrayCGH and/or SNP-array data from the same patients

The goal is to use the second two data sets as 'ground truth' by which to validate methods developed for the first data set.
